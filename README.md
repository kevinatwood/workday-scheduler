# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
This workday scheduler allows the user to organize their workday. It automatically updates to show the user future events, current events, and past events. All events are saved in local storage on the user's computer.


## Usage

Enter in events that occur throughout the day in the appropriate time block. Click on the save icon to save those events for future reference. The calendar will update automatically with the current time and date. If events change, delete and overwrite them by typing in a new event and clicking the save button.
